Freshly Made Pizzas
Create a Pizza class with the attributes order_number and ingredients (which is given as a list). Only the ingredients will be given as input.

You should also make it so that its possible to choose a ready made pizza flavour rather than typing out the ingredients manually! As well as creating this Pizza class, hard-code the following pizza flavours.

Name	Ingredients
hawaiian	ham, pineapple
meat_festival	beef, meatball, bacon
garden_feast	spinach, olives, mushroom
Examples
p1 = Pizza(["bacon", "parmesan", "ham"])    # order 1
p2 = Pizza.garden_feast()                  # order 2
p1.ingredients ➞ ["bacon", "parmesan", "ham"]

p2.ingredients ➞ ["spinach", "olives", "mushroom"]

p1.order_number ➞ 1

p2.order_number ➞ 2
